Hacked together formuale for working with some FPGA tools on a Mac.

- icestorm
- nextpnr-ice40

Poorly tested, somewhat old, these were made public so that I could download them without logging in.

That said, please feel free to use/improve/find bugs in this code as you see fit.
I'm happy to help on a best-effort basis, and if you find this useful, I'd appreciate it if you let me know.
